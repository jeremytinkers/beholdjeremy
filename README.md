# beholdJeremy

A minimalistic, personal website in React with a crude search function to filter out projects (sourced through Github's API) based on skill.

**Visit:** https://jeremytinkers.github.io/beholdjeremy/

**Do note:** This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**Bucket List:**-
1. Move to heroku/netlify
2. Autosuggest - either through a plugin or from scratch using a Trie
3. Management Profile Screen, rendered on toggle
4. Admin view to manage private projects
5. Supplementary views - Certs, Experience, etc
6. Better Responsiveness for Mobile
